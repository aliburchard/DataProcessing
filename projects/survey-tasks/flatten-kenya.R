############## INTERACTIVE - CLEANING OF CLASSIFICATION DATA AND SPECIFYING FIELDS ###################

# You will need to define variables that will be used in the run_json_parsing function. They need the following names:

# REQUIRED VARIABLES
# jdata
# survey_id
# workflow_id_num 
# workflow_version_num 

# OPTIONAL VARIABLES
# single_choice_Qs 
# single_choice_colnames 
# multi_choice_Qs 
# multi_choice_colnames


# Specify Project
project_name <- "kenya"
classifications_file <- "data/head_kenya.csv"

# Examine data
jdata <- read.csv(classifications_file, stringsAsFactors = F)

# Set project-specific details
check_workflow(jdata) %>% View
workflow_id_num <- 2030
workflow_version_num <- 307.77

# limit to relevant workflow id and version
jdata <- jdata %>% filter(., workflow_id == workflow_id_num, workflow_version == workflow_version_num) 

jdata %<>% head(n=1000)

# Identify task-specific details. These variable names are important, because I haven't figured out how to define them in the function call 
# (there's some weird referencing. I don't know. The function definitions and scripts could be improved, but things seem to generally work.)

View_json(jdata)
survey_id <- "T3"
single_choice_Qs <-  c("HOWMANY", "ARETHEREANYYOUNGPRESENT") # if the length of the columname vectors don't match, you'll get an error 
single_choice_colnames  <-  c("how_many", "young")
multi_choice_Qs <- c("WHATBEHAVIORSDOYOUSEE")
multi_choice_colnames <- c("behavior")

# Flatten by calling the code from the flattening_functions file. This isn't the cleanest approach, but it'll have to do.
# If you want to combine multiple workflows or multiple tasks before aggregating, this is the time to do it.

# ADD the nothing here questions back in. 
# Eventually would be good to add this bit back into the flattening script itself, though it could get complicated if multiple answers for a shortcut question, like in Serengeti.
